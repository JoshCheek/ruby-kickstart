Welcome to RubyKickstart!
=========================

**RubyKickstart is an interactive guide to learning the Ruby programming language.**

Please visit [our website](http://ruby-kickstart.com/) for videos and quizzes.
And get the [source code](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart) with notes and challenges.


How it works
============

RubyKickstart is downloaded onto your computer as a folder full of files and folders. 
It consists of six sessions, all of which have common features:

  **Videos**
  ----------
  Each session has a video where I go through the notes with some friends I made this material for. 
  Watch your way through the video and follow along with the material on your computer.

  **Notes**
  ---------
  Each session has a set of notes files, which are just simple Ruby programs that are heavily commented to walk
  through the material of that session. This is the material that we go through for each session.
	You can run them in IRB for example: require './notes/01-intro' and the text will print out.

  **Examples**
  ------------
  Existence of examples is intermittent. They are full Ruby programs that demonstrate the material taught in the notes.
  You can run them on your own and modify them to experiment with the ideas they demonstrate.

  **Quizzes**
  -----------
  Each session has an associated quiz available on the website. The quizzes test that you understood the material for the session.

  **Challenges**
  --------------
  Challenges are found in each session. They provide fun programming exercises for you to work through,
  so you have something to work on that utilizes the session's information. Challenges are taken
  from a few different places. Several are taken from different books that I have enjoyed, including the third edition
  of Absolute Java by Walter Savitch, which is probably my favourite CS book (for beginners), it was exceptionally well done,
  and one was taken from Learn to Program by Chris Pine, a book to teach programming to absolute beginners, using Ruby. 
  The rest were spawned out of my own brain, or from real world situations that I have found myself in.

  **Solved & Specs**
  -------------------
  Along with challenges, each session provides solutions to its challenges and
  a suite of automated tests you can use to test the correctness of your solutions.

  **Cheatsheets**
  ---------------
  Although not part of the sessions, RubyKickstart has a number of cheatsheets which contain all the syntax
  for various topics. Some of the material in the cheatsheets is not covered in the notes or examples for sessions,
  so make sure you check out the cheatsheets before diving into the challenges.

What you'll need to use it 
==========================

 To use RubyKickstart, you'll need several tools:

   - [**Ruby**](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) the happy programming language :)
   - [**Rake** version 0.8.7+](http://rubygems.org/gems/rake) see if you have it by typing "gem list" at the command line, we use it to apply the tests
   - [**RSpec** version 2.0+](http://rubygems.org/gems/rspec) currently we use this for testing
   - [**git**](http://help.github.com/git-installation-redirect) lets you download our changes without overwriting your work. Good installation instructions at (http://help.github.com/git-installation-redirect)
   - [**A text editor**](http://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl) Our Recommendations: 
     * Windows: [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html) should come with the one click installer
     * Linux: [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html) also works great on linux :)
     * Mac: [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) costs $50 but can be used by a beginner, and yet is powerful, has a community, and can be customized to meet your needs
