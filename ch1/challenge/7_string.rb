# Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring length 2 appears in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string, so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring).
# 
# last2("hixxhi")     # =>  1
# last2("xaxxaxaxx")  # =>  1
# last2("axxxaaxx")   # =>  2
