<b>In your life, when you need to conditionally do something, you use logic.
Logic has two values: true and false
You say things like "if it's raining and I have an umbrella I'll go outside, otherwise I'll stay inside."
This is a logical statement.</b>

==== Ruby has logic, too, so you can totally write a program to see if you should go outside, in fact, lets do it!

 def go_outside?( raining, umbrella )
   raining && umbrella
 end

 go_outside?( true  , true  )  # => true
 go_outside?( true  , false )  # => false
 go_outside?( false , true  )  # => false
 go_outside?( false , false )  # => false

==== Look, the go_outside? Method knows exactly what to do, because it knows about logic!
