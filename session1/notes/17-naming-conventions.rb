# All the variables we've seen so far have been local variables.
# That means they exist within the current scope, but if we leave it, they go away.

# Use snake_case with variables

# Constants are like variables, but you're telling the world that the value should not change.
# Any variable that starts with a capital letter is a constant.
# Use CamelCase with constants.

# Instance variables are variables that belong to an object rather than a scope.
# Any variable that starts with an '@' sigil is an instance variable.
# We'll talk more about these later.

# Remember when I said methods were their own little worlds? I lied.
# Constants can be seen by anything defined in their scope.

# question: classes begin with uppercase letters, are they constants?
#   Remember, constants are just variables that aren't supposed to change.
