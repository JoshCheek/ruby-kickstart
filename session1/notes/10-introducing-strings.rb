# For historical reasons, text in programming languages, is called a "string"
# think of it like you're stringing characters along a clothesline
# question: if 10.to_f converts 10 to a float, how would you convert 10 to a string?

"text".class # => String

# You can identify strings because they are surrounded in quotes

"abc" # => "abc"
'abc' # => "abc"
