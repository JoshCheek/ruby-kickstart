# Programs that run in a terminal read text in, and write text out.
# This is the common interface that allows lots of different programs to interact with each other.

# When a program outputs text, we say it sends it to standard output (stdout).
# In the terminal, anything your program sends stdout will display on your terminal.
# For example, cat sends a file's contents to standard output, echo sends its arguments to standard output.

# When it reads text in, it gets that from standard input (stdin).
# In the terminal, stdin is hooked up to your keyboard.
# Whatever you type will be sent to your program's stdin.

# Use gets to read a line from stdin
user_response = gets

# Use puts to write the line to stdout
puts "You said: #{user_response}"



# Watch out!
#
# A line is text that ends in a newline. line = "Line\n"
# When you read in the line, you also read in the newline.
# That means: line + line # => "Line\nLine\n"
#
# If you _actually_ wanted this: "LineLine"
# then you need to remove the newline.
#
# Ruby gives you a method named chomp that will give you that string without the newline
# line.chomp # => "Line"
# line       # => "Line\n"
#
# It's like a cookie monster for newlines!
