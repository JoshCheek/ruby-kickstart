# Okay, we made it through :)
# Now you just need to go do the challenges
#
# Open up the challenges in your text editor. Try to complete the first one.
# Then go to the terminal, and navigate to the directory with the Rakefile in it.
# Then run $ rake 1:1
#
# Did you pass? No?
# Okay, look at the output and try again. See what went wrong?
# Try again!
#
# Did you pass? Yeah?
# Great! No go finish the rest :D



# !!!!!!!!!!DON'T FORGET!!!!!!!!!
# There are cheat sheets to help you. You will need to reference them!
#
# How should you use the cheat sheets?
# Read them once so you know what kinds of things they contain.
# Then when you need to use something, first try to remember what it was.
# If you can't remember, then go look it up.
# Make a point of focusing on the answer, and try to recall it again immediately.
# This will help you quickly learn the things you want to use.
#
# You don't need to sit down and try to memorize the whole sheet (if you want to, you can)
# It's mostly important to know what general things they contain, and begin to memorize
# the parts that you use frequently.
