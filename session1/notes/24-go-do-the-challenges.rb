=== Okay, we made it through :)
==== Now you just need to go do the challenges.

==== Go to the terminal and cd into the root directory for ruby-kickstart.

=== Type rake 1:1

<b>Did you pass? No?
Open up the challenge in your text editor. Try to complete the first one.
Then go back to the terminal and type 'rake 1:1'.</b>

<b>Did you pass? No? Look at the output. See what went wrong?
Edit the challenge and try again!</b>

==== Did you pass? Yeah? Great! Now go finish the rest of the session1 :D



=== !!!!!!!!!!DON'T FORGET!!!!!!!!!
==== There are cheatsheets to help you. You will need to reference them!

==== How should you use the cheatsheets?
<b>Read them once so you know what kinds of things they contain.
Then when you need to use something, first try to remember what it was.
If you can't remember, then go look it up.
Make a point of focusing on the answer, and try to recall it again immediately.
This will help you quickly learn the things you want to use.</b>

<b>You don't need to sit down and try to memorize the whole sheet ( if you want to, you can )
It's mostly important to know what general things they contain, and begin to memorize
the parts that you use frequently.</b>
