# In the notes, examples and cheatsheets provided, we use a few conventions in our code to make it easy
# to see the results of expressions. To show the results of a line, we use the following notation

3 + 9       # => 12
my_var = 4
my_var      # => 4

# This shows what that line evaluates to, and in the case of a line with just a variable on it, shows the value
# of the object it refers to.

# For more complicated output, such as from a print statement, it'll be placed below the code.
