# Origins of the Ruby Language:
#   Written By: Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto)
#   First Public Release: 1995
#   Ruby is dynamic (interpreted), strongly typed (mostly), dynamically typed (known as duck typing)
#   Paradigms:
#     Procedural
#     OO (except for some operators, _everything_ is an object)
#     Functional

# Why Ruby?
#   It's hot! One of my instructors just sent this to our school's ACM mailing list:
#     % change in job openings from 2010
#     Ruby on Rails        +84%
#     Python               +53%

#   Okay, but what about Ruby not Rails?
#     $ rvm list known
#
#     See MacRuby? I predict Apple moves from Objective C to MacRuby.
#     That means if you want to develop the Mac, you use Ruby, it means
#     iPhone development in Ruby. Remember what happened to Objective C
#     when the iPhone came out? That boost can shift towards Ruby.
#
#     See JRuby? The JVM is awesome, you have that power in Ruby. There
#     are awesome Java libraries. You have that power in Ruby. Native
#     threading in Ruby. Anywhere the JVM is (portability).
#
#   Rubyists are happy. We love to program. We love elegance.
#   We are changing the way others look at software. Ruby on Rails
#   exploded onto the scene because it allowed for incredibly rapid
#   development, it was beautiful and elegant in the face of "spaghetti code"
#   prominent in the web domain, and because it cared enough to do things "right"
#   even when that meant thinking completely outside what had been done before
#   and pushing boundaries.
#
# Think about it, you can conceive of your own problems. And you can solve them.
# You can create anything you can conceive of, like a brilliant architect.
# "Whoever holds the keys to programming ends up building the reality in which the rest of us live."
