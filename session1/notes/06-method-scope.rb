# When you make a method, remember that it is its own little world,
# it doesn't know about anything outside of itself, this is called scope.

# Well that seems pretty useless, eh? Fortunately, there is an internet connection on this world!
# You can pass objects, into the method. When we pass an object in, the variable that points to it 
# is called an argument or a parameter

# person1 and person2 are arguments or parameters
