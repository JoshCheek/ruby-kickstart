<h3 id="label-Type+rake+1%3A1">Type rake 1:1</h3>

<p><strong>Did you pass? No? Open up the challenges in your text editor. Try
to complete the first one. Then go back to the terminal and type ‘rake
1:1’.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Did you pass? No? Look at the output. See what went wrong? Edit the
challenge and try again!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Read them once so you know what kinds of things they contain. Then
when you need to use something, first try to remember what it was. If you
can’t remember, then go look it up. Make a point of focusing on the answer,
and try to recall it again immediately. This will help you quickly learn
the things you want to use.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You don’t need to sit down and try to memorize the whole sheet ( if
you want to, you can ) It’s mostly important to know what general things
they contain, and begin to memorize the parts that you use
frequently.</strong></p>
