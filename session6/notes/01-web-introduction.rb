# Every building in America has an address so you can send letters
# to people who live there. In the same way, every computer on the
# internet has an address so you can send data to programs that
# are running there. This address is called an IP address and looks
# like 74.125.91.103

# When you send a letter to a building, there can be many people who
# live there, so you write the apartment number, or the person's
# name on the envelope. In the same way, when you send data to a
# computer, there can be many programs that are running there, so
# you specify which one you want to talk to by providing a port
# number. The port is just an address that programs can reside at,
# on the computer.

# Your web application will use a program called a server to watch
# the port for incoming data. The server will take the data, and
# provide it to your application in a way that your application
# can do something with it.
