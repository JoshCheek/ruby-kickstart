# Git is a source code management tool. It will keep track of all
# your changes. It will also let you interact with remote code.
# All of this code, for example, is maintained by git, and I can
# put it on GitHub so that everyone else can download it or even
# make changes and send them to me.

# In the same way my code is on GitHub, my code is also on Heroku.
# Heroku doesn't let anyone else see it like GitHub does, but
# when I use git to push my code to Heroku, my web application
# will automatically update.


# Lets initialize a new git repo in this directory with `$ git init`.

# We want to commit the contents into our git repository. So
# we add them to the staging area with `$ git add .` (remember
# the dot stands for the current directory) And then commit
# with `$ git commit "initial commit"`.


# Hooray, now our code is being managed by git. Lets make a
# change. You can see the change with `$ git status`.

# Go ahead and add it to the source code repository again.
