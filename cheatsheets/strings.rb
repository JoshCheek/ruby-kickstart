== Strings
=== This should get you started. 
=== But to see all the cool things you can do, check out the documentation.
=== http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html


=== Make a new string:

 "Can interpolate #{ 1 + 1 }"      # => "Can interpolate 2"
 'Cannot interpolate #{ 1 + 1 }'   # => "Cannot interpolate \#{ 1 + 1 }"

 string = <<END_OF_DOC.upcase
  This is a here document, I can interpolate #{ 1 }
  It will continue until it finds, the line END_OF_DOC by itself.
  Notice I can continue doing things on the line the here document is defined in.
  here I called String#upcase on it.
 END_OF_DOC

 string  # => 
 " THIS IS A HERE DOCUMENT, I CAN INTERPOLATE 1
 IT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL IT FINDS, THE LINE END_OF_DOC BY ITSELF.
 NOTICE I CAN CONTINUE DOING THINGS ON THE LINE THE HERE DOCUMENT IS DEFINED IN.
 HERE I CALLED STRING#UPCASE ON IT.
 "  

=== Useful methods:
 'abc'.length        # => 3
 'abc' == 'abc'      # => true
 'abc' == 'def'      # => false
 'AbCd'.downcase     # => "abcd"
 'AbCd'.upcase       # => "ABCD"
 " abc   ".strip     # => "abc"

=== concatenation:
 'hello' + 'world'   # => "helloworld"
 'hello' << 'world'  # => "helloworld"

==== wait O.o why two methods for this?
 s = "abc"
 s + "def"       # => "abcdef"
 s               # => "abc"
 s << "def"      # => "abcdef"
 s               # => "abcdef"

=== Access parts of the string: (-1 counts backwards from the end)
 "abc"[ -1 ]           # => "c"
 "abc"[ 0 ]            # => "a"
 "abc"[ 1 ]            # => "b"
 "abc"[ 2 ]            # => "c"
 "abc"[ 3 ]            # => nil
 "abcdefg"[ 2..4 ]     # => "cde"
 "abcdefg"[ 4..-1 ]    # => "efg"

=== Changing parts of a string:
 message = "Josh said"
 message[ "Josh" ] = "dom"
 message             # => "dom said"
 message += ' "Howdy"'
 message             # => "dom said \"Howdy\""
 message.capitalize  # => "Dom said \"howdy\""
 message             # => "dom said \"Howdy\""
 message[ -2 ] = 'e'
 message             # => "dom said \"Howde\""
 message[ -2 ] = 'y!'
 message             # => "dom said \"Howdy!\""

=== Other useful methods: ( some of these use regular expressions, we'll talk about them more later )
 "abc" * 3                                       # => "abcabcabc"
 " abc \n".chomp                                 # => " abc "
 'trite'.gsub( 't', 'b' )                        # => "bribe"
 "Their IDs are 11, and 492".scan( /\d+/ )       # => [ "11", "492" ]
 "Jack and Jill ran up the hill".split           # => [ "Jack", "and", "Jill", "ran", "up", "the", "hill" ]
 "/usr/bin:/opt/local:/Users/josh".split( ':' )  # => [ "/usr/bin", "/opt/local", "/Users/josh" ]
 "abcdefg hi".split( // )                        # => [ "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", " ", "h", "i" ]
