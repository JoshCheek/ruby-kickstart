<p># =====  What Are Gems?  ===== # In Ruby, third party libraries are called
gems # You can see a list of most of Ruby’s gems at rubygems.org</p>

<p># =====  How To Install  ===== # When you find one there that you are
interested in, e.g. BlueCloth, a gem to parse markdown and output html # <a
href="http://rubygems.org/gems/bluecloth">rubygems.org/gems/bluecloth</a> #
It will give you instructions on how to install it # $ gem install
bluecloth # # (note that if you are on OSX, and not using rvm, and haven’t
fixed your path, you may need to execute that with sudo)</p>

<p># =====  What Happens When You Install?  ===== # When you install a gem,
it, in turn, installs its dependencies # So installing Sinatra will also
install rack # BlueCloth doesn’t have any dependencies</p>

<p># It also builds code that is written in a language that needs to be
compiled (namely C) # So some libraries, like BlueCloth will require you to
have a compiler available to use to compile the gem for your system</p>

<p># It also builds documentation in the form of ri, and rdoc # To use ri, go
to the command line and type “$ ri topic”, ie “$ ri String” # To use the
rdocs, you can load up your own documentation server</p>

<p># =====  Documentation  ===== # To load up your own documentation Server #
$ gem server # # It will be hosted on some local port, probably 8808 # Go
to <a href="http://localhost:8808">localhost:8808</a> # Select the gem of
interest, the docs are there (for example, my bluecloth is at)</p>

<p># =====  Where Else To Look When Figuring Out How To Use It  ===== # I find
a combination of resources helpful, docs are just one # # Looking through a
gem’s source code to see how they implement # A given method, or how the
magic works, can be very helpful # # To get there, you you can go to your
gem directory, see this with # $ gem environment #  # If you have gem-open
(“$ gem install gem-open”), then you can open it directly with “$ gem open
gemname” #  # If you just want to see it quickly, you can follow the link
to the source host (probably github) # If you want to experiment with it,
you can git clone the source code into a directory on your machine # Then
you can play around without affecting your gems. # # A good example can
also be very helpful, google + blogs can be your friend :) # Oftentimes
there are also examples in the code # # Looking at what things the authors
taken the time to test can show you how they expected it to be used # And
what features and things they took the time to make sure work correctly #
Tests will either be in /spec or /test directories. # # For example,
looking at the BlueCloth homepage I didn’t see anything helpful. # I loaded
up the gem server, and felt unsure where the “overview” information was # I
looked at spec/bluecloth_spec.rb and saw the spec # it “allows output to be
rendered several times” do #   bc = BlueCloth.new( “Some text” ) #  
bc.to_html.should == bc.to_html # end # # Oh, I guess we can just drop our
markdown into the constructor, and call the instance method to_html (see me
do it below)</p>

<p># =====  Using Gems  ===== # Gems become available to you in your ruby
files # (On Ruby 1.8, you must require rubygems first.)</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">require</span> <span class="ruby-string">'bluecloth'</span>
</pre>

<p># now you are free to use it as you would any library, or even your own
code topics = BlueCloth.new &lt;&lt;CHAPTER_DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>Arithmetic</p>
</li><li>
<p>Logic</p>
</li><li>
<p>Basic IO</p>

<pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-identifier">topics</span>.<span class="ruby-identifier">to_html</span> <span class="ruby-comment"># =&gt; &quot;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arithmetic&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Logic&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic IO&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arrays&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;</span>
</pre>

<p># =====  Executables  ===== # Some gems have executables, if your rubygems
are set up properly, they will be made available # BlueCloth, for example,
has an executable. You can go see its source code in BlueCloth’s bin
directory # Here is an example of how to invoke it # $ bluecloth
