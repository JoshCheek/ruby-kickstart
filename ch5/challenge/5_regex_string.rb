# Let us revisit chapter 4 problem 6, this time leveraging the power of regular expressions.
#
# We'll say that a "triple" in a string is a char appearing three times in a row. 
# Return the number of triples in the given string. The triples may overlap. 
#
# count_triple("abcXXXabc")       # => 1
# count_triple("xxxabyyyycd")     # => 3
# count_triple("a")               # => 0
# count_triple("")                # => 0
# count_triple("XXXabc")          # => 1
# count_triple("XXXXabc")         # => 2
# count_triple("XXXXXabc")        # => 3
# count_triple("222abyyycdXXX")   # => 3
# count_triple("abYYYabXXXXXab")  # => 4
# count_triple("abYYXabXXYXXab")  # => 0
# count_triple("abYYXabXXYXXab")  # => 0
# count_triple("122abhhh2")       # => 1
