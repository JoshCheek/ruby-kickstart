# So gems sound great, everyone can share their code with each other.
# Just one problem, _how_ do we share it?

# Well, for that, there is RubyGems! http://rubygems.org a giant
# repository of gems that anyone can upload their gems to, or get
# their gems back from.

# You can peruse RubyGems, or check out http://ruby-toolbox.com/
# for a compilation of gems based on the types of tools you need.
# This is a great place to get ideas and see what tools the rest of
# the community think are useful for addressing certain types of
# problems.
