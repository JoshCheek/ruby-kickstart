# Lets say we want to write a web application. There are a ton of
# gems to help you do this
# http://ruby-toolbox.com/categories/web_app_frameworks.html


# I like Sinatra a lot. In fact, that's what ruby-kickstart.com uses!
# Lets go check out its RubyGems page http://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra


# Looks good, lets install it. We just need to tell RubyGems that
# we want it, and it will take care of everything involved.
# "$ gem install sinatra"


# If you have difficulty, it could be that your RubyGems is installed
# somewhere that requires you to be a superuser to make changes. In
# that case, try running "$ sudo gem install sinatra".
