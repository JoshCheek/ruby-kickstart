# Regular expressions are one of those things that look really scary,
# and take some time to get used to, but they are not that difficult
# to use, and they are _very_ useful. These are probably the things
# that are most useful to a non programmer, their job is to help you
# process Strings. They are patterns that strings can fit into.
# And they are mostly pretty easy :). You just have to learn a few
# rules, and have a cheatsheet until you get to know them.


# First, go check out rubular.com where you can put in a String and
# a regular expression, and you can see all the places it matches
# For the regular expression enter "b.b" and for the String,
# "bobbling babbling bubbles" Notice that it has highlighted "bob",
# "bab", and "bub". These are the areas where your regular expression
# matches the String (the dot matches any character).

# Strings begin and end with quotes, regexes with slashes
/this is a regular expression/
