# We've explained what an object is, data packaged
# together with methods. But how do we define
# what data our object should have, and how do we
# associate methods with that data?
#
# For that, we use classes :)


# Classes are containers for methods.
#
# When you have an object that uses those methods, we
# say it is an *instance* of that class.
#
# The instance keeps track of its class, then when you
# invoke a method on it, it finds the method by looking
# it up in the class.

# So, objects have methods, and those methods are
# defined in its class.
