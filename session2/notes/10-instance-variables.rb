# Objects store their state in instance variables

class Car

  # we call methods like this a "setter"
  def set_miles(miles)
    @miles = miles

  # we call methods like this a "getter"

    @miles

car = Car.new
car.set_miles 1000
car.get_miles # => 1000

car.instance_variables              # => [:@miles]
car.instance_variable_get '@miles'  # => 1000


# Question: We create our car by calling Car.new
# where is the new method defined?
