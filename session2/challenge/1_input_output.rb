# Write a program that reads in two integers typed on the keybaord
# and outputs their sum, difference, and product
#
# Standard input will be like "9 2\n" and will expect you to print
# "11\n7\n18\n" to standard output.

  puts input_one + input_two
  puts input_one - input_two
  puts input_one * input_two
