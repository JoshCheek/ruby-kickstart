# Define a class called Fraction
# This class is used to represent a ratio of two integers
# Include setter methods called numerator and denominator that allow the user to change these values
# Also include a method called to_f that returns the ratio as a float (a number with a decimal point, such as 10.3)
# Also include a method called lowest, which returns a new Fraction, where the numerator and denominator
# are reduced to lowest terms (ie 20/60 becomes 1/3)
# This will require finding the greatest common divisor for the numerator and denominator
# then dividing both by that number.
# I have included a greatest common divisor method for you
# You should also define a method, to_s, that will represent the Fraction as a String
#
# EXAMPLE:
# f = Fraction.new 20, 60
# f.numerator          # => 20
# f.denominator        # => 60
# f.to_s               # => "20/60"
# f.lowest.to_s        # => "1/3"
# f.numerator = 50
# f.denominator = 100
# f.to_s               # => "50/100"
# f.to_f               # => 0.5
