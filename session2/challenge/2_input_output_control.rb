# Prompt the user for a number, then read it in and print out "hi" that many times
#
# Repeat this process until the user submits "bye", then say "goodbye" and end the program
# HINT: Check out example 2 if you get stuck

# example:
# PROGRAM: Enter a number
# USER:    4
# PROGRAM: hi hi hi hi
# PROGRAM: Enter a number
# USER:    2
# PROGRAM: hi hi
# PROGRAM: Enter a number
# USER:    bye
# PROGRAM: goodbye


# remember you can try your program out with              $ ruby 2_input_output_control.rb
# and when you think it is correct, you can test it with  $ rake 2:2

def hi_hi_goodbye
  # your code here
  puts "Enter a number"
  number = gets.chomp
  if number != "bye"
    number.to_i.times { print "hi " }
    hi_hi_goodbye
  else
    puts "goodbye"
  end
end




# This will just invoke the method if you run this program directly
# This way you can try it out by running "$ ruby 2_input_output_control.rb"
# but it will still work for our tests
hi_hi_goodbye if $0 == __FILE__
