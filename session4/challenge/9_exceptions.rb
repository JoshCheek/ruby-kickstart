# You need to write a method that will take a person and
# generate their full name. A full name is just a first_name
# and a last_name separated by a space.
# 
# Sometimes, though, the code will raise a FirstNameError
# In these cases, just return their last name.
# 
# Other times, the code will raise a LastNameError
# In these cases, just return their first name.
# 
# And sometimes, it will raise other unexpected errors.
# In these cases, don't do anything, because we don't know
# why that error was raised.
